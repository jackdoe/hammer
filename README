small linux kernel module that creates interface in /proc
for connecting, sending and receiving tcp socket data.

* WARNING: might panic :) *

* build
    $ git clone https://github.com/jackdoe/hammer
    $ cd hammer && make clean all
    $ sudo insmod hammer

* connecting to something
    $ echo "bzbzb" nc -l 12345 # start netcat listener on port 12345
    $ sudo echo "127.0.0.1:12345" > /proc/hammer/__control
    $ sudo cat /proc/hammer/c_127.0.0.1:12345* 
    # you will see 'bzbzb'
    $ sudo echo "42" > /proc/hammer/c_127.0.0.1:12345*
    # you will see 42 on your netcat console

* aa... everything stays in memory. there is no mechanism for flushing anything,
  only unloading the module
